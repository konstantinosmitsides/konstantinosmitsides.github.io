I am a PhD student in AI at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in the [Adaptive & Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics), supervised by [Prof Antoine Cully](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully). I hold an MSc in AI from Imperial College London and a BSc in Mathematics from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). My research focuses on scalable exploration and adaptive learning for open-ended discovery in artificial intelligence.
