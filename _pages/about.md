I am a PhD student in AI at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in the [Adaptive & Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics), supervised by [Dr Antoine Cully](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully). My research focuses on developing learning algorithms to enable self-improving, generally capable agents in "open-ended" environments, advancing the field towards more autonomous and adaptive AI systems.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons]###(https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
